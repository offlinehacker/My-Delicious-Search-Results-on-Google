This Greasmonkey script(works on firefox and chromium) will insert Delicious search results of your bookmarks into a Google search page, on top.
It allow to do a search on google and in your delicious bookmarks in the same time.

If you are using Chrome/Chromium you have to change user staticly. Just replace del_username = "jakahudoklin"; with del_username = "your_user_name"; and install.

If you are using firefox first install greasmonkey then visit https://github.com/offlinehacker/My-Delicious-Search-Results-on-Google/raw/master/my_delicious_search_resu.user.js to automatically install script. After installing the script, in greasmonkey do "Set script commands"->"Set Delicious Username" and enter your delicious username.
